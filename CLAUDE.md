# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use `uv`, NEVER `pip`
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small and should have docstrings
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 120 chars maximum

- For commits fixing bugs or adding features based on user reports add:
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Reported-by:<name>"
  ```
  Where `<name>` is the name of the user.

- For commits related to a Github issue, add
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Github-Issue:#<number>"
  ```
- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Pull Requests

- Create a detailed message of what changed. Focus on the high level description of
  the problem it tries to solve, and how it is solved. Don't go into the specifics of the
  code unless it adds clarity.

- Always add and `reuteras` as reviewer.

- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Code Formatting

1. Ruff
   - Format: `uv run ruff format .`
   - Check: `uv run ruff check .`
   - Fix: `uv run ruff check . --fix`
   - Critical issues:
     - Line length (120 chars)
     - Import sorting (I001)
     - Unused imports
   - Line wrapping:
     - Strings: use parentheses
     - Function calls: multi-line with proper indent
     - Imports: split into multiple lines

2. Type Checking
   - Tool: `uv run pyright`
   - Requirements:
     - Explicit None checks for Optional
     - Type narrowing for strings
     - Version warnings can be ignored if checks pass

3. Pre-commit
   - Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Runs: on git commit
   - Tools: Prettier (YAML/JSON), Ruff (Python)
   - Ruff updates:
     - Check PyPI versions
     - Update config rev
     - Commit config first

## Error Resolution

1. CI Failures
   - Fix order:
     1. Formatting
     2. Type errors
     3. Linting
   - Type errors:
     - Get full line context
     - Check Optional types
     - Add type narrowing
     - Verify function signatures

2. Common Issues
   - Line length:
     - Break strings with parentheses
     - Multi-line function calls
     - Split imports
   - Types:
     - Add None checks
     - Narrow string types
     - Match existing patterns

3. Best Practices
   - Check git status before commits
   - Run formatters before type checks
   - Keep changes minimal
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Document public APIs
   - Test thoroughly

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Formatting**: Black-compatible style with 88 char line length
- **Type annotations**: Required for all functions, methods and parameters
- **Docstrings**: Google style docstrings required for public functions
- **Imports**: Use isort organization with profile=black
- **Error handling**: Use try/except with specific exceptions, log errors at appropriate levels
- **Naming**: Snake case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Async code**: Use asyncio properly with correct awaiting and typing

## Code Organization

- Textual TUI app architecture with screens, widgets and event handling
- Error handling should include appropriate logging and user notifications
- Use typing.Final/ClassVar for class constants and proper type annotations
