## Navigation Model
Readwise Reader TUI uses a single-window, stack-based navigation:
1. **Category List** → Select a category (Inbox, Later, Feed, Archive)
2. **Article List** → Select an article to read
3. **Article Reader** → Read the article with J/K navigation

## Category List Screen

- **d**: Toggle dark mode
- **q**: Quit

- **i**: Move article to Inbox
- **D**: Delete article (with confirmation)
- **o**: Open article in browser
- **,**: Refresh article list
- **space**: Load more articles

- Use **J / K** (uppercase) in the reader to navigate between articles without going back
- Use **Escape** or **Backspace** to go back at any level
- Articles are automatically marked as read when opened
- The app uses progressive loading - use **space** to load more articles
- Use **,** (comma) to refresh data from the API
